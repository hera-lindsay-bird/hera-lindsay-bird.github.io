# Javascript Intro

Welcome to Javascript! This challenge is made up of lots of little exercises. If you get stuck on any of the exercises, we recommend the following:
- Google! Research key words or concepts in the exercise
- Ask for help in the foundations Discord channel
- Move on to the next exercise and come back to unfinished exercises at a later time
- Message your facilitator for help

## Setup

In your terminal run the following commands to launch the application

```
npm install
npm run start
```

This should open up a web browser which will give you feedback as you progress. It should look like this initially:

Every time you complete an exercise the web page should automatically update with feedback on your progress (i.e. go from red to green). 

Watch the videos in the Handbook and work through the files in `src/challenges` (you can ignore the rest of the code, it's how we update the page with the feedback). E.g. watch the variables video, then complete the variables challenge, commit your work. Then watch the Functions video, then complete the functions challenge, commit your work etc. 

## Committing

Each time you want to commit, inside your terminal you'll need to press `Ctrl + c` to clear the `npm run start` command. You can then close the browser tab, and in your terminal add, commit, and push as normal. Once you're ready to move on to the next challange, type `npm run start` in to your terminal to launch another web browser. 

## Pro Tips for Navigating Javascript Intro

- You can view this readme in the browser, or in VS Code. For those who prefer to view the readme in VS Code, using `Ctrl + Shift + V` will provide you with a nicer reading experience.

- If you accidentally break the exercise - don't panic! You'll know the exercise is temporarily broken if the feedback interface is blank, and all the challenge results have disappeared. A tip for this would be to save and commit after each question you complete, so you know where issues are occuring and can undo the work you have most recently written and try again. A blank page means you aren't quite on the right path just yet, and that some of your code is breaking everything, but you can go back a few steps to restore the original question without your failing answer and you will be back in business.

- Are your answers failing but you feel 99% confident that you're on the right track? These challenges are strongly case sensitive and designed to encourage you to double check finer details like spelling, punctuation and so on. If you're finding an exercise is failing but you think you've got the right answer, check if you have used the exact spelling, and the upper or lower case usage as the question is asking for. I.e: 'Kia ora' with a capital K vs. 'kia ora' with a lowercase k.

- As Javascript is a language, naturally it has its own set of terms, phrases and jargon. If you're ever unsure of any of the words mentioned throughout Javascript intro, please check out the [JavaScript Glossary](https://handbook.eda.nz/foundations/resources/js-glossary). Alternatively, do a google search, ask for help in Discord or message your facilitator.

- The video tutorials introduce you to the core concepts. They are a starting point but some additional research may be required for some exercises - for example: switch, ternary operator, for in and for of in the loops challenge. These challenges are designed so that you can spend some time getting used to researching, and practising 'just in time' learning - so you can take in small pieces of content in a short time when you need the information without being overwhelmed with too much all at once.

- As always don't forget to commit early and commit often instead of waiting to make the commit perfect at the end, it is better to work in small chunks and keep committing your work!
