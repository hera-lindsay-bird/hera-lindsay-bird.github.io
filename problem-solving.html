      <h2>The Case of the Missing Parentheses</h2>

        In every great detective’s career, there comes a case which baffles even
        the most consummate professional.
        <br />
        <br />

        It was I, Hercule Poirot, who solved the mystery of the nested github
        repositories, and the double ubuntu’s, not to mention my notorious
        success with the case of the restricted access permissions. But a case
        which still haunts me to this day, is the<br /><br />

        <strong>CASE OF THE MISSING PARENTHESES</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        It was summer, and I was on the Riviera, with my good friend Hastings,
        recuperating from a difficult windows update (the culprit was a rogue
        graphics driver) and was looking forward to some well earned rest,
        drinking small restorative liqueurs and eating geometric foods. But
        alas, wherever Hercule Poirot goes, crime must follow. I was awakened
        the next morning by an urgent error message, saying:<br /><br />
        <strong>SYNTAX ERROR UNEXPECTED TOKEN</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        I immediately sprang into action, and quarantined the crime scene, by
        <span class="redtext"
          ><strong>commenting out sections of my earlier work</strong></span
        >
        by using <span class="redtext"><strong>//</strong></span> and
        <span class="redtext"><strong>*/</strong></span> I am, of course,
        familiar with such error messages. Missing parentheses are standard in
        this business. And I could see it was missing parentheses at once. The
        error message told me so. Either that or an extra parentheses. These
        notorious criminals travel in pairs. Such crimes are typically easily
        solved. But when I saw the error message saying
        <span class="plumtext"
          ><strong
            >the unexpected token could be found on the last line of the
            document</strong
          ></span
        >my suspicions were immediately aroused. The last line is often a red
        herring. Like the butler, he is often accused, but rarely guilty. I
        interrogated the last line, as a precaution, but I was not surprised to
        find it perfectly in order. And so my search began in earnest.
        <br />
        <br />
        I checked over the entire document first, to see whether I could see
        anything amiss. But everything seemed to be in order. I did not get down
        on my hands and knees and search amongst the carpets, like one of your
        Scotland Yard lackeys. I did not want to dirty my suit, which is of the
        most exquisite quality. The amateurs may search amongst the cigarette
        buts. But a professional such as myself has only to employ the little
        grey cells.
        <br />
        <br />
        I thought long and hard over the problem. But this problem was
        unfamiliar to me, and my normal methods of interrogating the suspects
        was difficult, as none of them spoke my native language, Belgian French,
        nor the English, in which I am also superior.
        <br /><br />
        In order to clear my mind
        <span class="bluetext"><strong>I went for a walk </strong></span>by the
        seaside.
        <span class="greentext"
          ><strong>
            I drank a large cocoa and pruned my moustaches</strong
          ></span
        >
        I <span class="lilactext"><strong>console logged</strong></span> various
        suspects to see if they were working as expected. I found, to my
        satisfaction, they were. So why the error message? It is like the rare
        case of finding a body, and not knowing who was murdered. <br /><br />
        I
        <span class="orangetext"
          ><strong>consulted to my colleague</strong></span
        >Sven Hjerson, an accomplished Finnish detective, but he was just as
        baffled as I. I talked to my friend Hastings, a notorious imbecile, who
        is easily misled
        <span class="bluetext"
          ><strong>(aka: The Rubber Ducky Method)</strong></span
        >
        Often his own disastrous apprehension of the situation allows me to see
        the truth with greater clarity.
        <span class="plumtext"><strong>I searched online</strong></span> to see
        if any similar crimes had been committed nearby. I accused a few
        functions at random, to see how they reacted. I thought over my earlier
        cases, but still I was stuck. Me, Hercule Poirot! <br /><br />
        I had a few suspects of course, one of which was a large and rather
        complex loop, who had arrived on the scene at around the same time as
        the error message. But when I went to interrogate the further, I
        discovered the loop had been murdered!
        <br /><br />
        <span class="greenertext"
          ><strong>I decided to try a small experiment</strong></span
        >
        I reproduced the crime scene containing the murdered loop in a sterile
        environment. I used console logging and node to autopsy the loop, to see
        if I could ascertain the cause of death. Under the
        <span class="orangetext"><strong>vscode</strong></span> scalpel, the
        coloured interface made it easier to see the issue. There, in the left
        pocket of the dead function, was the missing parentheses.
