    <h2>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
    <br />
    <p class="readabletext child-one">
      Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to perceive, understand and
      manage emotions, both of the self, and in others. To say someone's an
      emotionally intelligent person isn’t a value judgement. Think of Iago from
      Shakespeare. He was incredibly emotionally intelligent, and because of
      this he was easily able to manipulate those around him. Having a hard time
      perceiving the emotions of others, or regulating your own emotions doesn’t
      make you a bad person. We all know plenty of people who are perhaps not
      the most emotionally savvy individuals, but who are ultimately sweet at
      heart. Just think of Mr Bean! Sure, he’s a fictional character. But I
      think it’s important to make the distinction between being an emotionally
      intelligent person and a kind person.
      <br />

      <br />
      <br />
      Still, emotional intelligence is a useful skill to cultivate, through
      mindfulness practice, active listening and self reflections.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When I think of emotional intelligence, I think of the greatest television
      show of all time:

    <h2>SURVIVOR</h2>
    <br />
    <p class="readabletext child-two">
      Survivor is an incredible game, because it’s the most complicated game of
      human strategy. The winner of the game is selected by their own
      competitors, and anyone who wins Survivor has to be highly emotionally
      intelligent, because to win you have to be able to:
      <br />
      <br />Discern whether others are being truthful <br />Understand other
      people’s emotions at a high level <br />Convince other people to vote with
      you <br />Endear yourself to other people, and gain their trust and
      friendship <br />Lie effectively <br />Manipulate situations to your
      advantage (stealing rice to cause conflict amongst others) <br />Make a
      case for your performance to the jury <br />Perceive hidden alliances and
      social orders <br />Manage your own emotions under extreme exhaustion and
      regulate your behaviour <br />Not dissolve into spirals of paranoia, even
      though the paranoia is justified<br />
      And somehow still be liked and respected!<br />
      <br />That's charisma, baby!<br />
      <br />

      My favourite player is Sandra Diaz-Twine, perhaps one of the most
      emotionally intelligent people to ever live. She won the game twice, which
      should be impossible. But when you watch her game, and her instinctive
      ability to understand whether people are lying, and to manipulate and
      charm others, it’s like watching a new Einstein being born. A skill like
      hers cannot be learned. We can only fear and respect her.
