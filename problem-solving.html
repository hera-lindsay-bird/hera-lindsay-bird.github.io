    <h2>The Case of the Missing Parentheses</h2>
    <br>

      In every great detective’s career, there comes a case which baffles even
      the most consummate professional.
      <br />
      <br />
      It was I, Hercule Poirot, who solved the mystery of the nested github
      repositories, and the double ubuntu’s, not to mention my notorious success
      with the case of the restricted access permissions. But a case which still
      haunts me to this day, is the<br /><br />
      <strong>CASE OF THE MISSING PARENTHESES</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      It was summer, and I was on the Riviera, with my good friend Hastings,
      recuperating from a difficult windows update (the culprit was a rogue
      graphics driver) and was looking forward to some well earned rest,
      drinking small restorative liqueurs and eating geometric foods. But alas,
      wherever Hercule Poirot goes, crime must follow. I was awakened the next
      morning by an urgent error message, saying:<br /><br />
      <strong>SYNTAX ERROR UNEXPECTED TOKEN</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      I immediately sprang into action, and quarantined the crime scene, by
      <span class="redtext"
        ><strong>commenting out sections of my earlier work</strong></span
      >, by using <span class="redtext"><strong>//</strong></span> and
      <span class="redtext"><strong>*/</strong></span
      >. I am, of course, familiar with such error messages. Missing parentheses
      are standard in this business. And I could see it was missing parentheses
      at once. The error message told me so. Either that or an extra
      parentheses. These notorious criminals travel in pairs. Such crimes are
      typically easily solved. But when I saw the error message saying
      <span class="plumtext"
        ><strong
          >the unexpected token could be found on the last line of the
          document</strong
        ></span
      >, my suspicions were immediately aroused. The last line is often a red
      herring. Like the butler, he is often accused, but rarely guilty. I
      interrogated the last line, as a precaution, but I was not surprised to
      find it perfectly in order. And so my search began in earnest.
      <br />
      <br />
      I checked over the entire document first, to see whether I could see
      anything amiss. But everything seemed to be in order. I did not get down
      on my hands and knees and search amongst the carpets, like one of your
      Scotland Yard lackeys. I did not want to dirty my suit, which is of the
      most exquisite quality. The amateurs may search amongst the cigarette
      buts. But a professional such as myself has only to employ the little grey
      cells.
      <br />
      <br />
      I thought long and hard over the problem. But this problem was unfamiliar
      to me, and my normal methods of interrogating the suspects was difficult,
      as none of them spoke my native language, Belgian French, nor the English,
      in which I am also superior.
      <br /><br />
      In order to clear my mind,
      <span class="bluetext"><strong>I went for a walk </strong></span>by the
      seaside. I
      <span class="greentext"
        ><strong>drank a large cocoa and pruned my moustaches</strong></span
      >. I
      <span class="lilactext"><strong>console logged</strong></span> various
      suspects to see if they were working as expected. I found, to my
      satisfaction, they were. So why the error message? It is like the rare
      case of finding a body, and not knowing who was murdered. <br /><br />
      I <span class="orangetext"><strong>talked to my colleague</strong></span
      >, Sven Hjerson, an accomplished Finnish detective, but he was just as
      baffled as I. I talked to my friend Hastings, a notorious imbecile, who is
      easily misled
      <span class="bluetext"
        ><strong>(aka: The Rubber Ducky Method)</strong></span
      >
      Often his own disastrous apprehension of the situation allows me to see
      the truth with greater clarity.
      <span class="plumtext"><strong>I searched online</strong></span> to see if
      any similar crimes had been committed nearby. I accused a few functions at
      random, to see how they reacted. I thought over my earlier cases, but
      still I was stuck. Me, Hercule Poirot! <br /><br />
      I had a few suspects of course, one of which was a large and rather
      complex loop, who had arrived on the scene at around the same time as the
      error message. But when I went to interrogate the further, I discovered
      the loop had been murdered!
      <br /><br />
      <span class="greenertext"
        ><strong>I decided to try a small experiment.</strong></span
      >
      I reproduced the crime scene containing the murdered loop in a sterile
      environment. I used console logging and node to autopsy the loop, to see
      if I could ascertain the cause of death. Under the
      <span class="orangetext"><strong>vscode</strong></span> scalpel, the
      coloured interface made it easier to see the issue.
      <span class="lilactext"><strong>Viola!</strong></span> There, in the left
      pocket of the dead function, was the missing parentheses. I returned the parentheses to the correct place.
