<h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>

<p class="readabletext child-one">Sounds very fancy. But all it really refers to is the ability of the brain to adapt and change over our lifetimes. Young people have a high amount of neuroplasticity, as they are taking in new information constantly and forming new associations and memories. As we age, this process slows down a little. But of course we can still learn things. That’s just basic common sense. My grandmother doesn’t like to send me emails, but she can. Most people don’t win a nobel prize in mathematics until they’re at least like 75, probably. But any idea that we cannot continue to learn is of course nonsense. 
</p>
<p class="readabletext child-two">The frontal cortex of the brain takes the longest to develop, which means that people under 25 often have less impulse control than adults, which is why we have reduced sentencing for juvenile offenders etc, or people with head injuries. But the encouraging thing about this, is because the frontal cortex is the last to develop, it has the least to do with our genes and our upbringing, and is surprisingly malleable. There are proven ways to increase your neuroplasticity, some of which are:
</p>
<p class="readabletext child-one">
  Making sure you are sleeping well, eating well and exercising
  <br>
  Practising mindfulness and active reflection
  <br>
  Playing video games, apparently (not now mum, I’m working on my neuroplasticity homework!)
  <br>
  Novelty (seeking out new experiences, or learning new things)
