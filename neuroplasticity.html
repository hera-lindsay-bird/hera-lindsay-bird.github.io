      <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>

      <p class="readabletext child-one">
        Sounds very fancy. But all it really refers to is the ability of the
        brain to adapt and change over our lifetimes. Young people have a high
        amount of neuroplasticity, as they are taking in new information
        constantly and forming new associations and memories. As we age, this
        process slows down a little. But of course we can still learn things.
        That’s just basic common sense. My grandmother doesn’t like to send me
        emails, but she can. Most people don’t win a nobel prize in mathematics
        until they’re at least like 75, probably.

      <p class="readabletext child-two">
        There are proven ways to increase your neuroplasticity, some of which
        are: Making sure you are sleeping well, eating well and exercising
        <br />
        Practising mindfulness and active reflection
        <br />
        Playing video games, apparently <br />
        Novelty (seeking out new experiences, or learning new things)
