      <h4>Long term career goals</h4>

        <br />
        <br />
        One of my personal goals/priorities in life is to find a career which
        might better accommodate my hobbies. Working remotely, and getting paid
        better were both good incentives for me to enroll in this course. <br />
        <br />I’m not familiar enough with programming/coding to know what sort
        of careers or opportunities these skills might lead to, or whether I
        want a career in the industry, but I am optimistic and open minded.
        <br />
        <br />I’m interested in using the skills I learn in this course in
        various areas of my life, not just career. I can already see a lot of
        great potential for creative projects. I’m interested to hear from the
        perspective of others during this course, explore what a career in tech
        might look like!
      </p>

      <br />
      <h4>Learning strengths and limitations.</h4>
      <br />
      <p class="readabletext child-one">
        My strengths are that I'm a hard worker with a lot of persistence and
        optimism. My weaknesses are difficulties with relational logic and
        getting sidetracked by new ideas. I enjoy puzzles, but find it difficult
        to understand complicated mathematical concepts. I expect to struggle
        with the more difficult technical parts of this course.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Skills to develop</h4>
      <p class="readabletext child-two">
        I’d like to learn to work collaboratively on projects with other people.
        I think I have relatively good people skills, but I haven’t collaborated
        with many people in a professional context, which is obviously an
        important part of web development. I would also like to prove to myself
        that I can learn to code, as it’s extremely outside of my usual comfort
        zone.
      </p>
      <h4>Workload management.</h4>
      <p class="readabletext child-one">
        I'm going to frontload the beginning of my weeks with the core,
        technical stuff so that I can get a sense of how long it is taking me to
        understand the new concepts. This might look like working longer days on
        Monday to Wednesday, and if I’m running behind, I will have more of a
        buffer to catch up.
        <br />I’m going to keep up a good rapport with my cohort, particularly
        my homegroup, so that we can support each other throughout the process,
        and give each other help when we need it.
      </p>
      <p class="readabletext child-two">
        I am using a pig shaped egg timer (Rocksroy the pig) to measure my
        progress against the predicted time suggested for each exercise. I don’t
        always stick to these times, as I often have to revisit the lessons to
        make sure I understand, but it allows me to see how I am doing in
        relation to the weekly schedule.
        <br />
        <br />
        When things are building up, I will go for a walk, or take a break of
        some kind. Alternatively, I have a few good friends in tech jobs who
        have offered to call /look at my code, if I need help or encouragement.
      </p>
      <p class="readabletext child-one">
        I expect the facilitation team to communicate important course
        information to us in a timely way, listen to our concerns if we have
        any, be available to help with technical issues (to a reasonable
        extent.)
        <br />
        <br />
        The only scheduling conflicts I have are watching the premier league,
        Survivor, the UFC and feeding the cat twice a day.
