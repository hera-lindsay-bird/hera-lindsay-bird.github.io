      <h4>Values</h4>

      <p class="readabletext child-one">
        Recently I watched the Robert Sapolsky Stanford lecture series about
        behavioural biology and the cumulative effects of centuries of evolution
        on the human brain. One of the things Sapolsky emphasises again and
        again, is that even the most extreme set of environmental /neurological
        conditions (i.e a genetic predilection for disease x, or keeping a child
        in a cupboard) don’t determine an outcome.They can contribute to making
        an outcome more or less likely, or indeed, possible. But in the end the
        process by which we arrive at the people we become is infinitely opaque
        and infinitely complicated.
      </p>
      <p class="readabletext child-two">
        I don’t really know why I’m mentioning this, only that when you start
        coding it must be natural to begin to think of everything as code,
        including patterns of behaviour and thought. How infinite complexity can
        arise from simple chemical instructions. The brain is also like code, in
        that whoever wrote it, clearly wasn’t doing their refactoring
        effectively. It’s full of dead links and banal repetitions.
      </p>
      <p class="readabletext child-one">
        Anyway, this is where I’m supposed to be writing about the values I
        have. There’s an interesting bit in Sapolsky’s empathy lectures, where
        he talks about how people who record higher ‘empathy’ scores on tests
        are fundamentally more useless in an actual crisis, because their
        empathy centres become easily overwhelmed, paralysing them from taking
        action. I only mention this by way of saying, it sounds nice to say “I
        have value x” but whether or not that reflects in your behaviour is
        something else entirely…
      </p>
      <h4>Ethical decisions</h4>
      <p class="readabletext child-two">
        Once I got offered a lot of money to go and do comms for a bank. On the
        one hand, I could have definitely used a lot of money. On the other
        hand, what’s the point in having a heart and mind if you’re going to
        waste it all writing marketing copy for ANZ? In the end I decided not to
        take the job, even though it would have meant I had more time to spend
        on my own work. But I would have been embarrassed to tell people what I
        did for a living. Every now & again I think maybe I should have taken
        the job offer. But tmaybe I can go and work in their app development
        team instead, which is somehow infinitely better. Don’t ask me how. I
        just feel it in my heart.
      </p>
      <h4>Values and identity.</h4>
      <p class="readabletext child-one">
        The values I learned from my family were curiosity, willingness to
        try/fail, kindness/respect for others. In terms of identity, I don’t
        know. They say you spend the first half of your life trying to establish
        an identity and the second half trying to lose it. At the moment my
        identity consists of learning about the tudors, and watching Survivor. I
        once did the strengths finder test, as part of a job application, and my
        first strength was blankspace. Anyway, strengths finder tests are just
        horoscopes for the Myers Briggs crowd, so let’s just say, with full
        scientific integrity, I'm a Capricorn, which means I’m extremely
        determined, hard working, and single minded in pursuit of goals. Luckily
        I have Gemini rising, to take the edge off.
      </p>
      <p class="readabletext child-two">
        My limitations in terms of learning/career development are that I spent
        my twenties working in children’s bookshops, which is a very very good
        job if you don’t care about money. I am starting from scratch with
        coding, so there is a huge amount to learn if I decide to try and switch
        careers. I also know virtually nothing about programming, and so am
        starting with even less knowledge than others, who can effortlessly
        uninstall the bing taskbar on their mother’s computer without first
        having to read ten articles on the subject. I am committed to coding
        everyday/putting aside extra time to try and meet these limitations, and
        asking my more experienced cohort for help!
      </p>
      <p class="readabletext child-one">
        I'm nervous about the group exercises, particularly because I am behind
        most people in terms of tech skills and don't want to slow anyone down!
        I’ve done a few collaborative projects before. The process was; discuss
        an idea together, outline the individual parts, discuss a time frame,
        delegate work to each individual and then amalgamate the parts. If there
        is a conflict, one of our strategies was to have each person come up
        with their ideal version of the solution. These solutions are then
        discussed communally, and either combined, or one solution is chosen as
        better.
