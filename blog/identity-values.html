<h4>Values</h4>

<p class="readabletext child-one">Recently I watched the Robert Sapolsky Stanford lecture series about behavioural biology and the cumulative effects of centuries of evolution on the human brain. One of the things Sapolsky emphasises again and again, is that even the most extreme set of environmental /neurological conditions (i.e a genetic predilection for disease x, or keeping a child in a cupboard) don’t determine an outcome.They can contribute to making an outcome more or less likely, or indeed, possible. But in the end the process by which we arrive at the people we become is infinitely opaque and infinitely complicated.</p>
<p class="readabletext child-two">I don’t really know why I’m mentioning this, only that when you start coding it must be natural to begin to think of everything as code, including patterns of behaviour and thought. How infinite complexity can arise from simple chemical instructions. The brain is also like code, in that whoever wrote it, clearly wasn’t doing their refactoring effectively. It’s full of dead links and banal repetitions.</p>
<p class="readabletext child-one">Anyway, this is where I’m supposed to be writing about the values I have. There’s an interesting bit in Sapolsky’s empathy lectures, where he talks about how people who record higher ‘empathy’ scores on tests are fundamentally more useless in an actual crisis, because their empathy centres become easily overwhelmed, paralysing them from taking action. I only mention this by way of saying, it sounds nice to say “I have value x” but whether or not that reflects in your behaviour is something else entirely…</p>
<h4>Ethical decisions</h4>
<p class="readabletext child-two">Once I got offered a lot of money to go and do comms for a bank. On the one hand, I could have definitely used the money. On the other hand, what’s the point in having a heart and mind if you’re going to waste it all writing marketing copy for ANZ? In the end I decided not to take the job, even though it would have meant I had more time and money to do my own work. But I would have been so embarrassed to tell people what I did for a living. Every now & again (mould peeling off rental property wall)  I think maybe I should have taken the job offer. But then again, there are more than one ways to skin a cat. Maybe I can go and work in their app development team, which is somehow infinitely better. Don’t ask me how. I just feel it in my heart. </p>
<h4>Values and identity.</h4>
<p class="readabletext child-one">The values I learned from my family were curiosity, willingness to try/fail, kindness/respect for others and a general interest in social democracy and equality. In terms of identity, I don’t know. They say you spend the first half of your life trying to establish an identity and the second half trying to lose it. At the moment my identity consists of liking frogs & reptiles, learning about the tudors, and watching Survivor with Jeff Probst. I once did the strengths finder test, as part of a job application, and my first strength was blankspace. I can’t abide ‘strengths finders,’ which are just horoscopes for the Myers Briggs crowd, so let’s just say, with full scientific integrity, I am a Capricorn, which means I’m extremely determined, hard working, and single minded in pursuit of goals. Luckily I have Gemini rising, to add some party to the mix. </p>
<p class="readabletext child-two">My limitations in terms of learning/career development are that I’m currently unqualified to do almost anything. I spent my twenties working on creative stuff, and working in children’s bookshops, which is a very very good job if you don’t care about money. I am starting from scratch with coding, so there is a huge amount to learn if I decide to try and switch careers. I also know virtually nothing about programming, and so am starting with even less knowledge than others, who can effortlessly uninstall the bing taskbar on their mother’s computer without first having to read ten articles on the subject. I am committed to coding everyday/putting aside extra time to try and meet these limitations, and asking my more experienced cohort for help! </p>
<p class="readabletext child-one">I typically prefer working by myself, and am nervous about the group exercises, particularly because I am behind most people in terms of tech skills. I like having total control of a project. But I understand that isn’t how coding works, which means I’m going to have to get better at collaborating with others. I’ve done a few collaborative writing projects, which is a similar process to the staging/commit process, in which we’ll discuss an idea together, create scene outlines, delegate a part of the script to work on individually, and if resistance arises, one of our strategies was to have each person come up with their ideal version of the solution. These solutions are then discussed communally, and either amalgamated, or one solution is chosen as better.</p>
