       <h2>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
       <br>
       <div class="dv-box-child-three cleartext"> 
        Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to perceive, name and understand emotions, both of the self, and in others. To say someone is an emotionally intelligent person isn’t a value judgement. Think of Iago from Shakespeare. He was incredibly emotionally intelligent, and because of this he was easily able to manipulate those around him. Having a hard time perceiving the emotions of others,  or regulating your own emotions doesn’t make someone a bad person. We all know plenty of people who are perhaps not the most emotionally savvy individuals, but who are ultimately sweet at heart. Just think of Mr Bean! Sure, he’s a fictional character. But I think it’s important to make the distinction between being an emotionally intelligent person and a kind person.
