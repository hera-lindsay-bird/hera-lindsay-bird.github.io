      <h2>MARGINS, BORDERS & PADDING</h2>
      <br />

      <div class="dv-box">

          The internet is made of boxes<br /><br />Any HTML element on a website
          can be a "box" A picture of a horse. A paragraph of text. An
          interactive element, like a newsletter sign up form. <br /><br />
          But how do we arrange these "boxes" on the page? <br />
          <br />

          We are going to explore <span class="redtext">MARGINS</span>,
          <span class="plumtext">BORDERS</span> and
          <span class="greentext">PADDING</span> using the analogy of a
          painting/art gallery.
        </div>
        <br />
        <img class="img" src="/img/exampletwo.png" alt="crocodile picture" />
        <div class="dv-box-child-three">
          We can think of a webpage like the wall of an art gallery. And we can
          think of our elements as paintings. There are a number of paintings we
          want to hang on our gallery wall. But first, take a look at the
          painting above. In this analogy, the painting represents our element.
          The area between the element and the border is called padding. The
          border is our "picture frame." The margin is the empty space around
          each picture. <br /><br />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="box-demonstration">
        <div class="box">HERE IS A BOX</div>
      </div>
      <div class="dv-box">
        <div class="dv-box-child-one">
          This is the code I used to create the box pictured above. Here is the
          HTML:
        </div>
        <br />
        <img
          class="img dv-box-child-two"
          src="/img/boxdemo.png"
          alt="code screenshot"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="dv-box-child-one">
          This is an example of a class I made to style the box. If I wanted to
          change the padding, margin and border values of the yellow box I could
          do so by editing the values below
        </div>
        <br />
        <img
          class="img dv-box-child-two"
          src="img/boxdemotwo.png"
          alt="css screenshot"
        />
      </div>

      <div class="dv-box">
        <div class="dv-box-child dv-box-child-one">
          The margin is the space around the “painting.” We can think of it as
          an invisible barrier which surrounds each painting.
        </div>
        <br />
        <img
          class="img dv-box-child-two"
          src="/img/frogclean.jpg"
          alt="frog looking at paintings"
        />
        <div class="dv-box-child dv-box-child-one">
          wow, the margins on these paintings sure are strange...
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="dv-box">
        <div class="dv-box-child-one">
          The border is the edge of the element or the painting. The border is
          by default invisible, although it's easy to change the border's
          colour, syle and size using css classes. You can think of the border
          like a picture frame
        </div>
        <br />
        <img
          class="img"
          src="img/frognoborder.jpg"
          alt="frog looking at paintings"
        />
        <div class="dv-box-child dv-box-child-one">
          hmm, this painting seems to have an invisible picture frame
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="dv-box">
        <div class="dv-box-child-one">
          Padding is the area between the border (picture frame) and the content
          (picture of alligator riding mouse.) These paintings have no visible
          padding. Maybe they'd look nicer with a little breathing room?
